# LEMONGRAB

Gather company data from mobygames and wikidata and build awesome research 
datasets and visualizations.This tool provides various commands to fetch data 
(via cli) and visualize it (via browser).

## Requirements

* Python 3.7
* [unified api](https://git.sc.uni-leipzig.de/ubl/diggr/infrastructure/unifiedapi)
* [diggrtoolbox](https://github.com/diggr/diggrtoolbox)

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the requirements

```zsh
$ git clone https://git.sc.uni-leipzig.de/ubl/diggr/general/lemonggrab
$ cd lemongrab && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

The tool provides the following commands, which are intended to be used in the 
following order. The first two commands (*company-dataset* and *wikidata-mapping*)
generate/fetch the dataset and the mapping. The third command (*company-network*)
builds a *GraphML* file to be inspected (e.g. with *Gephi*). The fourth command
(*browser*) starts a web application which can be used to inspect the companies 
fetched earlier.

## Usage
